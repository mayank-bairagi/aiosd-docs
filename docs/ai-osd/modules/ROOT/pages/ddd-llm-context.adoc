= 🎯 DDD-Aware LLM Context Framework
:navtitle: LLM Context Strategy for DDD
:description: Blueprint for selecting code context for LLMs using Domain-Driven Design

== 🎯 Goal

Create a framework or blueprint that specifies *what* and *how much* of your codebase to supply to an LLM, in combination with requirements/user stories, when your system follows Domain-Driven Design.

== 🧱 Foundation: What Makes DDD Special for LLM Context?

DDD promotes clear, self-contained bounded contexts.

- Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, and Domain Services *encode business rules* — the LLM must understand them.
- Application Layer *orchestrates*, bridging user intent and domain logic.
- Infrastructure can be ignored for most LLM use cases (initial development, logic reasoning).

== 🧠 The Generalized Strategy: “DDD-Aware LLM Context Framework”

=== 🧩 1. Domain Layer

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| Artifact Type | Inclusion Guidance

| Entities       | ✅ Include signatures + relevant methods (skip getters/setters/toString)
| ValueObjects   | ✅ Include complete class if small and self-contained
| Aggregates     | ✅ Include public interface (methods + invariants)
| Domain Services| ✅ Include signature and key methods
| Domain Events  | ✅ Include if used in the flow
| Repositories   | ✅ Only the interface; skip implementations
| Enums / Types  | ✅ Include fully—they are often small and semantic
|===

==== 🛠 Option: Signature-Only View

[source,kotlin]
----
class User(val id: UUID, val email: Email, val password: Password) {
    fun register(): ...
    fun activate(): ...
}
----

This reduces token cost and still gives the LLM a high-level understanding.

=== 🧩 2. Application Layer

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| Artifact Type | Inclusion Guidance

| Application Services | ✅ Include existing use cases as examples
| Commands / DTOs       | ✅ Include fields + validation annotations if any
| Service Interfaces     | ✅ Include if domain logic depends on abstractions (e.g. Hasher, Mailer)
| Error Handling Models  | ✅ Include types for consistent result modeling
|===

🚦 *Tip:* Choose 1–2 relevant examples that match the type of user story (e.g., if the story is about creation, show `OrderService.createOrder()`).

=== 🧩 3. User Story (Requirement)

Prefer structured format (Gherkin, AsciiDoc, Markdown)

Include:

- User Story (Who, What, Why)
- Acceptance Criteria (bullets or BDD-style)
- Edge Cases and Security Considerations

🧠 *Tip:* Use the user story as the *primary prompt*, and all the code as *context documents*.

== 📦 Optional Context Enhancers

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| Artifact | When to Include

| Unit Tests        | To show business expectations
| Validation Rules  | If decoupled from domain, e.g., custom annotations
| UML/Class Diagrams| In design-phase generation
|===

== 🧰 Example Folder Strategy

[source,plaintext]
----
📁 llm_context/
├── domain/
│   ├── entities/
│   ├── valueobjects/
│   └── repositories/
├── application/
│   └── services/
├── user_story/
│   └── registration.adoc
----

== 🧠 Smart Principles (Decision Matrix)

[cols="1,3,2",options="header"]
|===
| Principle | Why it Matters | Apply When

| Context over code volume  | LLMs perform better with clear, concise semantics | Prefer signatures and summaries
| Bounded Context Isolation | Prevents domain leakage and improves relevance   | Use folder-based filtering
| Semantic Density          | High business meaning per token                  | Prefer Value Objects, Aggregates
| Orchestration Examples    | Helps LLM mimic correct flow                     | Provide 1–2 real Application Services
|===

== 📌 Final Checklist: What to Pass

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| Layer       | Recommended Content

| Domain      | Signatures of Entities, VOs, Aggregates, Interfaces
| Application | Relevant Application Services + Command DTOs
| Requirements| Structured User Story + Acceptance Criteria
| Optional    | Domain Events, Value validation logic
